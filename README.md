vcsmap
========

vcsmap is a plugin-based tool to scan public version control systems (currently GitHub and [possibly Gitlab soon](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/556)) for sensitive information like access tokens and credentials.

## Installation
Install the package wity RubyGems.
```
gem install vcsmap
```

## Usage
vcsmap already includes a couple of plugins. Each plugin looks for files that match a certain search query, and extracts the right data from those files. To view all plugins run:
```
$ ruby vcsmap.rb list
```

To use a plugin, look up the name of the plugin (`[plugin_name]`) and run the following command. Data is saved in CSV format to the `output` directory.

**To authenticate with Github you need to set a `GITHUB_COOKIE` environment variable with a valid Github `user_session` cookie value.**
```
$ ruby vcsmap.rb run {plugin_name} {pages} {--no-ascii}
```
- You need to specify the amount of pages you want to search. Each (GitHub) page has 10 possible results.
- Use the `--no-ascii` flag (last) to disable rendering the results as an ASCII table in the command line.

## Plugin development
To add a new plugin, create an entry for it in `lib/plugin_list.rb` and create a new plugin class that extends `Vcsmap::Plugin::BasePlugin` in `lib/plugins`. 

Each plugin has a `@search_string` that is used to search for matching files, and a couple of regex matchers to extract the needed data. Of course you don't need to use regex, it's also possible to parse the file (e.g. with `JSON`), as long as your plugin returns a valid `table_header` and matching `credentials`.

**The easiest way** to develop a new plugin is to copy an simple existing one (like `lib/plugins/solr_dataconfig.rb`) and modify it until it fits your requirements. Need inspiration? Check out [techgaun/github-dorks](https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks/blob/master/github-dorks.txt)!.
